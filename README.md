This script currently supports .npz and .envi formats!

There are __strict__ dependencies on library versions, they are listed in requirements.txt, I suggest you to use separate anaconda or python environment.

Run "python prediction.py --help" to check how to use it.

If you'd like to see all the data, research notebooks, plots, weights etc. you can checkout notebooks branch.

In case of any questions contact me on nechaev.dv@phystech.edu
