This script currently supports .npz and .envi formats!

There are __strict__ dependencies on library versions, they are listed in requirements.txt, I suggest you to use separate anaconda or python environment.

Run "python prediction.py --help" to check how to use it.

In case of any questions contact me on fruitpizza49@gmail.com
