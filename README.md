This script currently supports .npz and .envi formats!
There are strict dependencies on library versions, they are listed in requirements.txt, I suggest you to use separate anaconda or python environment.
Use "python prediction.py --help" to check how to use it.
In case of any questions contact me on fruitpizza49@gmail.com
